                <li>Observation: Observe something that you want to understand or want to know more about. Ex. leaves are green</li>
                <br>
                <li>Question: Make a question about the observation. Ex. Why are leaves green </li>
                <br>
                <li>Hypothesis: Create a testable statement or prediction about the question. Ex. Leaves are green because some pigment in them doesn’t absorb green</li>
                <br>
                <li>Prediction: State what you think will happen if the hypothesis is correct. Ex. Leaves are green because the chlorophyll in them doesn’t absorb green</li>
                <br>
                <li>Experiment: Design and began a test to gather data to test the hypothesis. Ex. Test what chemicals in leaves reflect green light .</li>
                <br>
                <li>Analysis: Analyze the data to see if it supports or disproves the hypothesis. Ex. The chemical that gives leaves the green look is chlorophyll thus proving the hypothesis.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Conclusion: Make conclusions based on the data, and revise the hypothesis or ask new questions if needed. Ex.  Chlorophyll gives off the green look to leaves without it they are red-brown.</li>
